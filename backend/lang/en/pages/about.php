    'story.description' => 'Ever since I was three years old, I’ve been captivated by the inner workings of the world around me—tinkering, dismantling, and rebuilding whatever I could get my hands on. A funny story from my childhood: at the age of four, I decided to take apart floor lamps and electrical sockets (thankfully, I emerged unscathed). Growing up in the Bay Area, where I still live today, my curiosity evolved into an engineer’s mindset—constantly constructing household items out of Legos, including a working drill with a real drill bit. At eight, I fell in love with computer science and programming, determined to explore every aspect of the field. By age 14, I had mastered Java, Python, and JavaScript, and a year later, I embarked on a mission to develop an online education initiative focused on accessible, project-based learning while using its revenue for charitable causes. Scouting has been another significant part of my journey; as a member of Cub Scouts, then Boy Scouts, I honed leadership skills through planning and executing meetings and projects. In 2025, I plan to complete my Eagle Scout project, the final step in earning the prestigious award that only 6% of scouts achieve—a testament to my commitment and determination. Today, I’m an aspiring entrepreneur, passionate about innovation and making a difference in the world.',

    'skillset.description' => 'With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Java, and Python, I am proficient in building secure, scalable, and efficient software. I work comfortably with frameworks like React, Laravel, SASS, and Spring, and I’m constantly expanding my skillset—currently diving into computer architecture in my free time. My interests extend beyond software development; I’ve dabbled in electrical engineering, building my first PCB in 2024 for a battle bot as part of the robotics and engineering club, where I serve as president. Leadership is at the core of who I am. I’ve held roles like Senior Patrol Leader in my Boy Scout troop, where I led outings and projects, and I’ve served as a TA for an Intro to Robotics class, teaching soldering and project planning. Whether managing entrepreneurship initiatives or leading clubs, I’m a communicator, collaborator, and problem-solver who values teamwork and respect. A simple “hello” can brighten someone’s day, and I try to embody that kindness daily. Above all, I’m passionate about helping others and tackling challenges head-on, whether through code, hardware, or creative leadership.'
